# URL Data Extractor

## Description
This Flask application allows users to input a URL, from which it scrapes data, specifically focusing on extracting certain numerical values from tables within the page. The application identifies specific values based on predefined keywords and calculates an average based on the extracted data. This is useful for quickly gathering and analyzing data from structured web pages without manual intervention.

## Features
- Extracts data from tables in web pages based on predefined keywords.
- Performs calculations to find averages and other relevant statistics.
- Simple web interface for easy interaction.
